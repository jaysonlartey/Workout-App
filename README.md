## Project Overview
The **IWorkout** app is a workout tracking and planning application designed to help users log their workouts and track progress over time.

## Features

### **Login/Signup**
- **Login Page**: Users are required to log in to access the app.
- **Sign In Page**: New users can sign up to create an account.
- **Backend Integration**: When users log in or sign up, the app communicates with the backend to authenticate users and store their data.


### **Home Page**
- Once logged in, users are redirected to the **Home Page** which displays user information and has buttons to access the workout planner and workout viewer pages.

### **Workout Planner**
- Users can log workouts by selecting the date, naming the workout, and entering the number of sets and reps. The workout is then sent to the backend via a **POST** request to store in the database.

### **View Workouts**
- Users can view their logged workouts in a weekly format, with options to edit or delete workout details.
